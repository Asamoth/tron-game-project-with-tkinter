# **PvP TRON game using tkinter**

This was a first simple project to work with GUI on python via the tkinter module.
The game is pretty simple : it's a sort of player vs player snake game.
Each player's avatar moves inside the canvas using WASD and the arrow keys.
The player's goal is to avoid any collision and trap the other player to trick them into a collision.
As you move inside of the canvas, your avatar leaves a colored trail behind that is a collidable object.
The more times you press a key in a direction, the faster you will go. Holding down a key however serves no purpose.
